      "We have read [this humorous short play](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2009/july/if-youre-typing-the-letters-a-e-s-into-your-code-youre-doing-it-wrong/)",
      "We are not using weak Cryptography algorithms DES/3DES or weak hash algorithm MD5/SHA1, only strong crypto is used (PBKDF2 or Bcrypt for password hash, SHA-256 for hashing and AES-2048 for assymetric encryption",
      "We are storing the currently used algorithm in addition to the encrypted or hashed text, to allow us to roll forward to different algorithms in the future (cryptographic agility).",
      "We have ensured implementing encryption does not introduce any denial-of-service conditions (e.g. performing cryptography on strings longer than 500 characters)",
      "When encryption features are implemented, we have think about expiration and revocation mechanisms"
